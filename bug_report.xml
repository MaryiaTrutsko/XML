  <field Bug Details ="Bug Details">The tester didn't provide any data about the application version and testing environment. We will talk through these details further in the article. As for the priority, testers usually assign a priority level, which may change later</field>
  <field Bug Description = "Bug Description">This section raises the most questions. Here, the tester should explain Steps to Reproduce, Actual Results, and Expected Results.
